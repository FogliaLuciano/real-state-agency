<h3>Group proyect for Data Management subject for third year in Systems Information Engineer at UTN FRBA</h3>

We were given a master table with all the data. We had to migrate it into smaller tables according to the entities we recognized.
Later on, we had to make a BI MODEL using the star model for data analysis. In addition, another requirement was to make a couple of views so that we were able to see the data according to what we wanted to see.
